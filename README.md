# Events Duplicator

Takes one or more source calendars and duplicates the events to a target calendar.

Runs with a time-based trigger to keep the ORFE Calendar relatively up-to-date.

Supports external calendars indirectly. Subscribe to any ICS feed within Google Calendar, then the feed becomes a source calendar for the purpose of this script.
